# Hello-World
Hi, colleages out there!
Am Dawood Morris F Kaundama. I admit, I was born with tech-capable skills, because I used to 'fix', rather open internet (temper with some internet settings of different mobile phones for internet connectivity) and it always worked! I was just a kid then. i always cried for a conducive environment for fleshing out ideas. Now I wish to apply real word skills to problem solving. Am not praising myself! Dont get me wrong guys! But I just need some support and a team to work with. Thanks.
